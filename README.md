Projects and labs for UC Berkeley CS61a

4 projects and 10labs&hws. Cs 61a is a well-taught and well-designed fundamental course. Although I have been familiar with python before taking it, I can still learn many interesting stuff from every lecture. What is the most inspiring is that the professor taught this course not only from one details to the other detail but brid-view the industry sometimes. The course gave me great motivation in learning cs!
